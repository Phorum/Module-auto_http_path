Changelog:
----------

2011-03-30 1.0.7

    - Some more updates to make the path detection more robust.

2011-02-20 1.0.6

    - An attempt to fix some strange issue where the http_path is broken
      (i.e. empty) for Phorum scripts that are run from cron.

    - Updates to the automatic HTTP path generation code, to accomodate
      for the use of path info in a URL (this makes this module work for
      URLs like http://site.com/forum/index.php/a/b/c?xyz)

2008-07-30 1.0.5

    - Added compatibility for the $PHORUM['template_http_path'] variable.
      That one needs some rewriting too, since it's based on the
      $PHORUM['http_path']. We do not change this variable if some other
      mod changed it already. In that case, the files might be coming
      from some CDN.

2008-01-22 1.0.4

    - Fixed a problem with the stub CSS and JavaScript code that this
      module registers. Winzip did not unpack the zero byte css.tpl.
      I changed the code to let the module provide the stub code by
      means of a function instead. That should work in all cases.

      Thanks to Steve Healy for reporting this issue.

2008-01-19 1.0.3

    - Fixed undefined index warning for the css register hook.

    - The http_path is not generated anymore for the admin interface.

    - Added a formatting fixup hook that will rewrite URLs in subjects
      and bodies that use the original http_path to the dynamic http_path.
      This is for example needed for the smileys module, which caches the
      URLs for the smiley images from the admin using the configured
      http_path.

      Thanks to Steve Healy for reporting these issues.

2008-01-18 1.0.2

    - The module now makes Phorum use the correct URLs in cached
      CSS and JavaScript code.

2007-12-08 1.0.1

    - Use common_pre hook instead of common.

    - Strip ending slash for the http_path. That is how Phorum expects it.

2007-11-30 1.0.0

    - Initial release
