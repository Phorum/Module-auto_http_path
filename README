Module  : Automatic HTTP Path
Version : 1.0.8
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module automatically sets the HTTP Path configuration option, based
on the active URL. This can be useful if for some reason you run one
Phorum install under various host names and/or directories (e.g. a
Phorum on a private space intranet server that is also accessible
through a public URL or a server that has to be accessible on both an
http:// and https:// URL).


Installation:
-------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "auto_http_path" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Automatic HTTP Path".
